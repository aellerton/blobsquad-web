## The Blob Squad

For lovers of the Blob Fish - and who isn't.

We use `pnpm` but you can use `npm` or `yarn`.

First time:

```bash
$ pn install
```

Serve:

```bash
$ pn dev
```

Build the `dist` folder:

```bash
pn build
```

Deploy the `dist` folder to any static host provider (netlify, surge, now, etc.
